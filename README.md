# Beats for Bits

Welcome to Beats for Bits, an experiment in tinkering with Bitcoin and the Lightning Network. It is web application where you can buy my music using satoshis - tiny units of Bitcoin. This was my capstone project for BrainStation's 3 month software engineering bootcamp. 

There is an accomponying backend which you can find on my profile labelled as beats-for-bits-api. You will need this in order to get the music and photos.
